# Algorithms

Linear Search:
- We look at every element in an Array or ArrayList starting at the 0th index, and then we iterate until we find the element we are searching for or until we reach the end of the Array or ArrayList.
- The maximum amount of time it will take to find the element we are looking for is the length of the list, n<br>
  Time Complexity: O(n)

Binary Search:
- The time complexity of the binary search is O(log n) because with each iteration, the size of the search space is reduced by half. At each iteration, the algorithm divides the search space in half by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array.
