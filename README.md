Linear Search:
- We look at every element in an Array or ArrayList starting at the 0th index, and then we iterate until we find the element we are searching for or until we reach the end of the Array or ArrayList.
- The maximum amount of time it will take to find the element we are looking for is the length of the list, n<br>
  Time Complexity: O(n)
